\section{Technical Approach}	% no limits given
\label{sec:technical_approach}

In this Section all the technical aspects of the project will be presented. A quick explanation of the various simulators implemented will follow in Subsection~\ref{subsec:math_models}. To follow the historical development of the subject, citations will follow a different order from the one proposed. Note that all of the equations have been slightly modified in order to obtain unit power fading channels and to unify the notation.

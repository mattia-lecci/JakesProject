\section{Technical Approach}	% no limits given
\label{sec:technical_approach}

In this Section all the technical aspects of the project will be presented. A quick explanation of the various simulators implemented will follow in Subsection~\ref{subsec:math_models}, following the history of the subject. That is the reason why the order of the citations will be different from the one proposed. Note that all of the equations have been slightly modified in order to obtain unit power fading channels and to unify the notation.

Throughout the years, many wireless channel simulators have been proposed with different performance objectives. In this project I will implement 8 of them, explaining how they work, the differences from one another and, finally, testing statistical and computational performance, comparing all of them in order to find their strengths and weaknesses.

As expected, there is no single winner, but two of them will show appreciable characteristics in separate performance indexes. You will see how the fastest performer will present below average statistical properties and how, maybe surprisingly, the original Clarke's model will actually yield the best overall statistical performance with a speed comparable to more modern solutions

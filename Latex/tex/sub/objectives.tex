The main objective of the project is to evaluate the performance of different types of wireless channel simulators. In particular, I'm interested, here, in simulating a Rayleigh fading channel, namely a channel where no Line-Of-Sight (LOS) component is present. I will show both statistical and performance results for all of the 8 simulators implemented, comparing them to one another.

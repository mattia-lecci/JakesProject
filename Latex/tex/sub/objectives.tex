The main objective of this project is to evaluate the performance of different types of wireless channel simulators. In particular, I'm interested, here, in simulating a Rayleigh fading channel, namely a channel where no \textit{Line-Of-Sight} (\textit{LOS}) component is present. I will show both statistical and performance results for all of the 8 simulators implemented, comparing them to one another.
